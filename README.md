# My .dotfiles

So obviously this is a work in progress. I'm also very new to all this so things might look a little rough. Please don't give me a hard time.
The initial goal was to create a backup of my lovely NeoVim status.
Aim is to add all sorts of useful stuff related to configurations (as a backup and also if I ever have another machine that needs to be configured) later on.


## ToDo

- [ ] Add more config files
    - Bash profile
        - Separately aliases, functions, etc?
    - Some basic vim setup if neovim is not an option?
- [ ] Create 'install.sh' or similar to easily get things going with Stow in another machine
    - Also fonts, plugins needed by neovim (which are???) and stuff, I have to think about all the stuff I've configured so far
- [ ] Look at other dotfile setups and replicate what looks nice :person_fencing:



## Neovim

So this setup has been created with the help of Josean and Primeagen (will link helpful videos later?)

### Current plugins

- Telescope
- Treesitter
- nvim-cmp
- lualine
- dressing
- vim-fugitive
- Full lsp support! :tada:

### Colorscheme

I'm using the classic tokyonight colorscheme by Folke.
